# MsgVpnQueue

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**AccessType** | **string** | The access type for delivering messages to consumer flows bound to the Queue. Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as egressEnabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;\&quot;exclusive\&quot;&#x60;. The allowed values and their meaning are:  &lt;pre&gt; \&quot;exclusive\&quot; - Exclusive delivery of messages to the first bound consumer flow. \&quot;non-exclusive\&quot; - Non-exclusive delivery of messages to all bound consumer flows in a round-robin fashion. &lt;/pre&gt;  | [optional] [default to null]
**ConsumerAckPropagationEnabled** | [****bool**](*bool.md) | Enable or disable the propagation of consumer acknowledgements (ACKs) received on the active replication Message VPN to the standby replication Message VPN.

**QueueName** | **string** | The name of the Queue. | [optional] [default to null]
**RedeliveryDelayEnabled** | [****bool**](*bool.md) | Enable or disable a message redelivery delay. When false, messages are redelivered as soon as possible.  When true, messages are redelivered according to the initial, max and multiplier.  This should only be enabled when redelivery is enabled. Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as egressEnabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;false&#x60;. Available since 2.33. | [optional] [default to null]
**RedeliveryDelayInitialInterval** | **int32** | The delay to be used between the first 2 redelivery attempts.  This value is in milliseconds. Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as egressEnabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;1000&#x60;. Available since 2.33. | [optional] [default to null]
**RedeliveryDelayMaxInterval** | **int32** | The maximum delay to be used between any 2 redelivery attempts.  This value is in milliseconds.  Due to technical limitations, some redelivery attempt delays may slightly exceed this value. Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as egressEnabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;64000&#x60;. Available since 2.33. | [optional] [default to null]
**RedeliveryDelayMultiplier** | **int32** | The amount each delay interval is multiplied by after each failed delivery attempt.  This number is in a fixed-point decimal format in which you must divide by 100 to get the floating point value. For example, a value of 125 would cause the delay to be multiplied by 1.25. Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as egressEnabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;200&#x60;. Available since 2.33. | [optional] [default to null]
**RedeliveryEnabled** | [****bool**](*bool.md) | Enable or disable message redelivery. When enabled, the number of redelivery attempts is controlled by maxRedeliveryCount.

**RejectLowPriorityMsgLimit** | **int64** | The number of messages of any priority in the Queue above which low priority messages are not admitted but higher priority messages are allowed. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;0&#x60;. | [optional] [default to null]
**RejectMsgToSenderOnDiscardBehavior** | **string** | Determines when to return negative acknowledgements (NACKs) to sending clients on message discards. Note that NACKs cause the message to not be delivered to any destination and Transacted Session commits to fail. Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as rejectLowPriorityMsgEnabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;\&quot;when-queue-enabled\&quot;&#x60;. The allowed values and their meaning are:  &lt;pre&gt; \&quot;always\&quot; - Always return a negative acknowledgment (NACK) to the sending client on message discard. \&quot;when-queue-enabled\&quot; - Only return a negative acknowledgment (NACK) to the sending client on message discard when the Queue is enabled. \&quot;never\&quot; - Never return a negative acknowledgment (NACK) to the sending client on message discard. &lt;/pre&gt;  Available since 2.1. | [optional] [default to null]
**RespectMsgPriorityEnabled** | [****bool**](*bool.md) | Enable or disable the respecting of message priority. When enabled, messages contained in the Queue are delivered in priority order, from 9 (highest) to 0 (lowest). MQTT queues do not support enabling message priority. Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as egressEnabled and ingressEnabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;false&#x60;. Available since 2.8. | [optional] [default to null]
**RespectTtlEnabled** | [****bool**](*bool.md) | Enable or disable the respecting of the time-to-live (TTL) for messages in the Queue. When enabled, expired messages are discarded or moved to the DMQ. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is &#x60;false&#x60;. | [optional] [default to null]
