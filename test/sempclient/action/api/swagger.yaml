  title: SEMP (Solace Element Management Protocol)
  description: "SEMP (starting in `v2`, see note 1) is a RESTful API for configuring,\
    \ monitoring, and administering a Solace PubSub+ broker.\n\nSEMP uses URIs to\
    \ address manageable **resources** of the Solace PubSub+ broker. Resources are\
    \ individual **objects**, **collections** of objects, or (exclusively in the action\
    \ API) **actions**. This document applies to the following API:\n\n\nAPI|Base\
    \ Path|Purpose|Comments\n:---|:---|:---|:---\nAction|/SEMP/v2/action|Performing\
    \ actions|See note 2\n\n\n\nThe following APIs are also available:\n\n\nAPI|Base\
    \ Path|Purpose|Comments\n:---|:---|:---|:---\nConfiguration|/SEMP/v2/config|Reading\
    \ and writing config state|See note 2\nMonitoring|/SEMP/v2/monitor|Querying operational\
    \ parameters|See note 2\n\n\n\nResources are always nouns, with individual objects\
    \ being singular and collections being plural.\n\nObjects within a collection\
    \ are identified by an `obj-id`, which follows the collection name with the form\
    \ `collection-name/obj-id`.\n\nActions within an object are identified by an `action-id`,\
    \ which follows the object name with the form `obj-id/action-id`.\n\nSome examples:\n\
    \n```\n/SEMP/v2/config/msgVpns                        ; MsgVpn collection\n/SEMP/v2/config/msgVpns/a\
    \                      ; MsgVpn object named \"a\"\n/SEMP/v2/config/msgVpns/a/queues\
    \               ; Queue collection in MsgVpn \"a\"\n/SEMP/v2/config/msgVpns/a/queues/b\
    \             ; Queue object named \"b\" in MsgVpn \"a\"\n/SEMP/v2/action/msgVpns/a/queues/b/startReplay\
    \ ; Action that starts a replay on Queue \"b\" in MsgVpn \"a\"\n/SEMP/v2/monitor/msgVpns/a/clients\
    \             ; Client collection in MsgVpn \"a\"\n/SEMP/v2/monitor/msgVpns/a/clients/c\
    \           ; Client object named \"c\" in MsgVpn \"a\"\n```\n\n## Collection\
    \ Resources\n\nCollections are unordered lists of objects (unless described as\
    \ otherwise), and are described by JSON arrays. Each item in the array represents\
    \ an object in the same manner as the individual object would normally be represented.\
    \ In the configuration API, the creation of a new object is done through its collection\
    \ resource.\n\n## Object and Action Resources\n\nObjects are composed of attributes,\
    \ actions, collections, and other objects. They are described by JSON objects\
    \ as name/value pairs. The collections and actions of an object are not contained\
    \ directly in the object's JSON content; rather the content includes an attribute\
    \ containing a URI which points to the collections and actions. These contained\
    \ resources must be managed through this URI. At a minimum, every object has one\
    \ or more identifying attributes, and its own `uri` attribute which contains the\
    \ URI pointing to itself.\n\nActions are also composed of attributes, and are\
    \ described by JSON objects as name/value pairs. Unlike objects, however, they\
    \ are not members of a collection and cannot be retrieved, only performed. Actions\
    \ only exist in the action API.\n\nAttributes in an object or action may have\
    \ any combination of the following properties:\n\n\nProperty|Meaning|Comments\n\
    :---|:---|:---\nIdentifying|Attribute is involved in unique identification of\
    \ the object, and appears in its URI|\nConst|Attribute value can only be chosen\
    \ during object creation|\nRequired|Attribute must be provided in the request|\n\
    Read-Only|Attribute can only be read, not written.|See note 3\nWrite-Only|Attribute\
    \ can only be written, not read, unless the attribute is also opaque|See the documentation\
    \ for the opaque property\nRequires-Disable|Attribute cannot be changed while\
    \ the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled|\n\
    Auto-Disable|Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of\
    \ the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as one or more\
    \ attributes will be temporarily disabled to apply the change|\nDeprecated|Attribute\
    \ is deprecated, and will disappear in the next SEMP version|\nOpaque|Attribute\
    \ can be set or retrieved in opaque form when the `opaquePassword` query parameter\
    \ is present|See the `opaquePassword` query parameter documentation\n\n\n\nIn\
    \ some requests, certain attributes may only be provided in certain combinations\
    \ with other attributes:\n\n\nRelationship|Meaning\n:---|:---\nRequires|Attribute\
    \ may only be changed by a request if a particular attribute or combination of\
    \ attributes is also provided in the request\nConflicts|Attribute may only be\
    \ provided in a request if a particular attribute or combination of attributes\
    \ is not also provided in the request\n\n\n\nIn the monitoring API, any non-identifying\
    \ attribute may not be returned in a GET.\n\n## HTTP Methods\n\nThe following\
    \ HTTP methods manipulate resources in accordance with these general principles.\
    \ Note that some methods are only used in certain APIs:\n\n\nMethod|Resource|Meaning|Request\
    \ Body|Response Body|Notes\n:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---\nPOST|Collection|Create\
    \ object|Initial attribute values|Object attributes and metadata|Absent attributes\
    \ are set to default. If object already exists, a 400 error is returned\nPUT|Object|Update\
    \ object|New attribute values|Object attributes and metadata|If does not exist,\
    \ the object is first created. Absent attributes are set to default, with certain\
    \ exceptions (see note 4)\nPUT|Action|Performs action|Action arguments|Action\
    \ metadata|\nPATCH|Object|Update object|New attribute values|Object attributes\
    \ and metadata|Absent attributes are left unchanged. If the object does not exist,\
    \ a 404 error is returned\nDELETE|Object|Delete object|Empty|Object metadata|If\
    \ the object does not exist, a 404 is returned\nGET|Object|Get object|Empty|Object\
    \ attributes and metadata|If the object does not exist, a 404 is returned\nGET|Collection|Get\
    \ collection|Empty|Object attributes and collection metadata|If the collection\
    \ is empty, then an empty collection is returned with a 200 code\n\n\n\n## Common\
    \ Query Parameters\n\nThe following are some common query parameters that are\
    \ supported by many method/URI combinations. Individual URIs may document additional\
    \ parameters. Note that multiple query parameters can be used together in a single\
    \ URI, separated by the ampersand character. For example:\n\n```\n; Request for\
    \ the MsgVpns collection using two hypothetical query parameters\n; \"q1\" and\
    \ \"q2\" with values \"val1\" and \"val2\" respectively\n/SEMP/v2/action/msgVpns?q1=val1&q2=val2\n\
    ```\n\n### select\n\nInclude in the response only selected attributes of the object,\
    \ or exclude from the response selected attributes of the object. Use this query\
    \ parameter to limit the size of the returned data for each returned object, return\
    \ only those fields that are desired, or exclude fields that are not desired.\n\
    \nThe value of `select` is a comma-separated list of attribute names. If the list\
    \ contains attribute names that are not prefaced by `-`, only those attributes\
    \ are included in the response. If the list contains attribute names that are\
    \ prefaced by `-`, those attributes are excluded from the response. If the list\
    \ contains both types, then the difference of the first set of attributes and\
    \ the second set of attributes is returned. If the list is empty (i.e. `select=`),\
    \ it is treated the same as if no `select` was provided: all attribute are returned.\n\
    \nAll attributes that are prefaced by `-` must follow all attributes that are\
    \ not prefaced by `-`. In addition, each attribute name in the list must match\
    \ at least one attribute in the object.\n\nNames may include the `*` wildcard\
    \ (zero or more characters). Nested attribute names are supported using periods\
    \ (e.g. `parentName.childName`).\n\nSome examples:\n\n```\n; List of all MsgVpn\
    \ names\n/SEMP/v2/action/msgVpns?select=msgVpnName\n; List of all MsgVpn and their\
    \ attributes except for their names\n/SEMP/v2/action/msgVpns?select=-msgVpnName\n\
    ; Authentication attributes of MsgVpn \"finance\"\n/SEMP/v2/action/msgVpns/finance?select=authentication%2A\n\
    ; All attributes of MsgVpn \"finance\" except for authentication attributes\n\
    /SEMP/v2/action/msgVpns/finance?select=-authentication%2A\n; Access related attributes\
    \ of Queue \"orderQ\" of MsgVpn \"finance\"\n/SEMP/v2/action/msgVpns/finance/queues/orderQ?select=owner,permission\n\
    ```\n\n### where\n\nInclude in the response only objects where certain conditions\
    \ are true. Use this query parameter to limit which objects are returned to those\
    \ whose attribute values meet the given conditions.\n\nThe value of `where` is\
    \ a comma-separated list of expressions. All expressions must be true for the\
    \ object to be included in the response. Each expression takes the form:\n\n```\n\
    expression  = attribute-name OP value\nOP          = '==' | '!=' | '<' | '>' |\
    \ '<=' | '>='\n```\n\n`value` may be a number, string, `true`, or `false`, as\
    \ appropriate for the type of `attribute-name`. Greater-than and less-than comparisons\
    \ only work for numbers. A `*` in a string `value` is interpreted as a wildcard\
    \ (zero or more characters). Some examples:\n\n```\n; Only enabled MsgVpns\n/SEMP/v2/action/msgVpns?where=enabled%3D%3Dtrue\n\
    ; Only MsgVpns using basic non-LDAP authentication\n/SEMP/v2/action/msgVpns?where=authenticationBasicEnabled%3D%3Dtrue,authenticationBasicType%21%3Dldap\n\
    ; Only MsgVpns that allow more than 100 client connections\n/SEMP/v2/action/msgVpns?where=maxConnectionCount%3E100\n\
    ; Only MsgVpns with msgVpnName starting with \"B\":\n/SEMP/v2/action/msgVpns?where=msgVpnName%3D%3DB%2A\n\
    ```\n\n### count\n\nLimit the count of objects in the response. This can be useful\
    \ to limit the size of the response for large collections. The minimum value for\
    \ `count` is `1` and the default is `10`. There is also a per-collection maximum\
    \ value to limit request handling time.\n\n`count` does not guarantee that a minimum\
    \ number of objects will be returned. A page may contain fewer than `count` objects\
    \ or even be empty. Additional objects may nonetheless be available for retrieval\
    \ on subsequent pages. See the `cursor` query parameter documentation for more\
    \ information on paging.\n\nFor example:\n```\n; Up to 25 MsgVpns\n/SEMP/v2/action/msgVpns?count=25\n\
    ```\n\n### cursor\n\nThe cursor, or position, for the next page of objects. Cursors\
    \ are opaque data that should not be created or interpreted by SEMP clients, and\
    \ should only be used as described below.\n\nWhen a request is made for a collection\
    \ and there may be additional objects available for retrieval that are not included\
    \ in the initial response, the response will include a `cursorQuery` field containing\
    \ a cursor. The value of this field can be specified in the `cursor` query parameter\
    \ of a subsequent request to retrieve the next page of objects.\n\nApplications\
    \ must continue to use the `cursorQuery` if one is provided in order to retrieve\
    \ the full set of objects associated with the request, even if a page contains\
    \ fewer than the requested number of objects (see the `count` query parameter\
    \ documentation) or is empty.\n\n### opaquePassword\n\nAttributes with the opaque\
    \ property are also write-only and so cannot normally be retrieved in a GET. However,\
    \ when a password is provided in the `opaquePassword` query parameter, attributes\
    \ with the opaque property are retrieved in a GET in opaque form, encrypted with\
    \ this password. The query parameter can also be used on a POST, PATCH, or PUT\
    \ to set opaque attributes using opaque attribute values retrieved in a GET, so\
    \ long as:\n\n1. the same password that was used to retrieve the opaque attribute\
    \ values is provided; and\n\n2. the broker to which the request is being sent\
    \ has the same major and minor SEMP version as the broker that produced the opaque\
    \ attribute values.\n\nThe password provided in the query parameter must be a\
    \ minimum of 8 characters and a maximum of 128 characters.\n\nThe query parameter\
    \ can only be used in the configuration API, and only over HTTPS.\n\n## Authentication\n\
    \nWhen a client makes its first SEMPv2 request, it must supply a username and\
    \ password using HTTP Basic authentication, or an OAuth token or tokens using\
    \ HTTP Bearer authentication.\n\nWhen HTTP Basic authentication is used, the broker\
    \ returns a cookie containing a session key. The client can omit the username\
    \ and password from subsequent requests, because the broker can use the session\
    \ cookie for authentication instead. When the session expires or is deleted, the\
    \ client must provide the username and password again, and the broker creates\
    \ a new session.\n\nThere are a limited number of session slots available on the\
    \ broker. The broker returns 529 No SEMP Session Available if it is not able to\
    \ allocate a session.\n\nIf certain attributes—such as a user's password—are changed,\
    \ the broker automatically deletes the affected sessions. These attributes are\
    \ documented below. However, changes in external user configuration data stored\
    \ on a RADIUS or LDAP server do not trigger the broker to delete the associated\
    \ session(s), therefore you must do this manually, if required.\n\nA client can\
    \ retrieve its current session information using the /about/user endpoint and\
    \ delete its own session using the /about/user/logout endpoint. A client with\
    \ appropriate permissions can also manage all sessions using the /sessions endpoint.\n\
    \nSessions are not created when authenticating with an OAuth token or tokens using\
    \ HTTP Bearer authentication. If a session cookie is provided, it is ignored.\n\

    \n## Notes\n\nNote|Description\n:---:|:---\n1|This specification defines SEMP\
    \ starting in \"v2\", and not the original SEMP \"v1\" interface. Request and\
    \ response formats between \"v1\" and \"v2\" are entirely incompatible, although\
    \ both protocols share a common port configuration on the Solace PubSub+ broker.\
    \ They are differentiated by the initial portion of the URI path, one of either\
    \ \"/SEMP/\" or \"/SEMP/v2/\"\n2|This API is partially implemented. Only a subset\
    \ of all objects are available.\n3|Read-only attributes may appear in POST and\
    \ PUT/PATCH requests. However, if a read-only attribute is not marked as identifying,\
    \ it will be ignored during a PUT/PATCH.\n4|On a PUT, if the SEMP user is not\
    \ authorized to modify the attribute, its value is left unchanged rather than\
    \ set to default. In addition, the values of write-only attributes are not set\
    \ to their defaults on a PUT, except in the following two cases: there is a mutual\
    \ requires relationship with another non-write-only attribute, both attributes\
    \ are absent from the request, and the non-write-only attribute is not currently\
    \ set to its default value; or the attribute is also opaque and the `opaquePassword`\
    \ query parameter is provided in the request.\n\n"
